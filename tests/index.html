	<h3>A Girl Who's Puzzled by Yorkville</h3>
	<p>I recently moved out of the East Village, and am pleasantly surprised by some of the downtown-ish ammenities (ok, bars) in my new neighborhood. Which has led me to wonder - what is Yorkville? A term invented by brokers? A real neighborhood? Or just the Upper East Side in weekend clothing?</p>
