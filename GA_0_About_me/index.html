	<h2>A Tech-Savvy Communicator</h2>
	<p>As Project Manager for the court-appointed administrator of an ongoing discrimination case, I've reviewed and edited system specs with an eye to the court's data expectations. As a Referral Hall Monitor, I've overseen increased usage of the largest of these systems by 400%.</p>

	<h3>An Enthusiastic Web-Developer</h3>
	<p>To better communicated with developers, I learned front-end web development and have completed several projects of my own. (Check out my work<!--Probably obvious, but the following links aren't to my work.--> <a href="http://smollin.com/michael/tmonstr/mon001.html">here</a>, <a href="http://ny.racked.com/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/">here</a>.) I've had fun in the process, and look forward to developing this skill set further.</p>

	<h3>A Girl Puzzled by Yorkville</h3>
	<p>I recently moved from the Lower to the Upper East Side, and am pleasantly surprised by some of the downtown-ish ammenities (ok, mostly bars) up here. Which has led me to wonder - what is Yorkville? I thought it was a name invented by brokers, but might it be ... an actual neighborhood?</p>

	<h2>Enough about me ...</h2>
	<p>I'd love to hear from you! For more information about any of my projects, or to share your theory about Yorkville, shoot me an email.
